Websockets:
what if we store in a Database and keep retriving information form there
Websockets very useful for solving problem of https response
Whenever we send request from a website and get response in return We(Client) are not always connected with server
If we want a real time application then there must be strong link between client and server so as server can also push update
HTTP Request cannot connect server client (NOT POSSIBLE IN HTTP PROTOCOL) 

Websocket makes two way communication
like http & https
similarly here:
  ws & wss (Web socket secure protocol) [ its like




We implement with Socketio of Nodejs




1st Description:
 we simply make an interface chat type application in analogous to whatsapp using HTML and CSS Front end running on server port 5500

2nd Description:
 we create another folder for backend purpose using nodeserver.... (typing npm init) just after installing Nodejs in the built in terminal of VS code after changing directory to backend folder then
 package.json is created 

install npm i socket.io in the builtin terminal of VS code within backend folder
then we create index.js in that backend folder in which Node server which will handle socket io connections

EVENTS::
const io = require('socket.io')(7000) you can take any port 7000 or 8000
io.on means instance of socket.io which listens many socket connections like harry connected, Rohan connectde
people texting messages to each other IO.ON LISTENS THESES ALL Socket.on -> What should happen with a particular connection

if other user joinst we insert event: socket.broadcast.emit
lets test socket server
   npm i nodemon
  nodemon ./index.js WE WILL RUN NODE SERVER SUCCESSFULLY


WE make client.js under js folder


TO CONNECT CLIENT WITH SERVER: we add in index.html script tags:
           // FORM DOCUMENTATION OF SOCKET.IO
<script defer src="http://localhost:7000/socket.io/socket.io.js"></script>
    <script defer src="js/client.js"></script>


In client we write all the function events like where the messages to be dislplayed in the container tag of CSS etc input messages etc etc

we create two websites  client.js and Nodejs(index.js)as a backend..basically we need to make connection between them


in HTML page we use script src (/socket.io/socket.io.js)  FROM SOCKETIO DOCUMENTATION ! //including a javascript file basically















Why does my variable show it's deprecated?



suppose 10 people are in connected through Node server if a new user sends message he broadcasts to 9 other people
that this person has sent message that sends event Names"received" this event is to be received in client.js 

socket.on('receive',data=>{
    append('${data.message}: ${data.users}','left');
})

e se reload nhi hoga page bar bar

FOR SENDING MESSAGE:
form.addEventListener('submit', (e)=>{
    e.preventDefault();
    const message = messageInput.nodeValue;
    append('You: ${message}','right');
    socket.emit('send',message);
    messageInput.value= ''  // after sending message blank space
})


user se disconnect karneka even server se chalo bhejte hai
user se discnnoe...bhejna hai server se client k taraf
then socket server sends an event its name is disconnect.......from socket documentation
 socket.on('disconnect', message=> {
    socket.broadcast.emit('left', users[socket.id])
    delete users[socket.id];
  })

client will listen


AT THE MOMENT WE ARE USING THIS in same computer we can host this nodeserver 
and people from different place will connect this nodeserver





2 tabs we can pretend communication between two users
if We open in incongnito 3 people all group
